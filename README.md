# ServerClientHearts

The project for the server-client based Hearts game I'm trying to make.

## Getting Started

To run the project,
1. Make sure you have Java 8 installed (project was only tested on Java 8)
2. Download the required libraries (JUnit 5, JetBrains annotations library)
3. Run ui.client.Main (for the Client) or ui.server.Main for the server.

### Prerequisites

Java 8, JUnit 5, and the JetBrains annotations library.

## Running the tests

Navigate to src/test/, and select the test you want to run (e.g. CardTest), and run the test with JUnit 5 (your IDE may have an option to run each test individually).
