# ServerClientHearts

The server for the server-client based Hearts game I'm trying to make.

## Getting Started

To run the project,
1. Make sure you have Java 8 installed (Processing's libraries requires Java 8)
2. Download the required libraries (Processing's net library and Processing core, JUnit 5)
3. Run ui.javaver.Main (for the Client) or ui.SCHServer for the server.

### Prequisites

Java 8, Processing's net library, Processing's core library, and JUnit 5.

## Running the tests

Navigate to src/test/, and select the test you want to run (e.g. CardTest), and run the test with JUnit 5 (your IDE may have an option to run each test individually).
