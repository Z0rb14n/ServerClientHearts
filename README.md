# ServerClientHearts

The server for the server-client based Hearts game I'm trying to make. If you stumbled into it, congratualations.

For information on the Processing Libraries, just search up Processing or PApplet and you'll probably find it.

For help on the testing libraries just search up JUnit 5. I could've used a junit5.xml maven repo, but I had this from CPSC 210 so might as well use it.
